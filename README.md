# Breakdown Notes:

 - Calva getting started
 - Clojure getting started: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started
    - Get 'clojure' CLI installed
 - Create `yc-bootstrap` folder
 - Open in vscode, create deps.edn, follow https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli

You should now have a very basic project going - good time to get some git integration going.

Enter the following in your .gitignore:

```gitignore
.clj-kondo/.cache
.cpcache
.lsp
.calva/output-window
.nrepl-port
```

Namespace Require auto-management
